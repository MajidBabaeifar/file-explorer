# Features

This is a mock project of a file explorer directory.
I mostly worked on the logical features and worked with the dependencies I was asked to during our last interview.
It uses a mock data in constant folders that you can edit.
The project is now set for text and image files.

Due to shortage of time this weekend, this is all I could provide, I hope it points out what you wanted to evaluate.
Since you mostly wanted to evaluate my speed, you should know that building this whole project from zero, took me about 5 hours.

Thank you for your time
